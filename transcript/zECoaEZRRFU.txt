i'm absolutely convinced this will eradicate 
and cure Alzheimer's really the data don't  
lie and I'm a data guy and that the future of 
medicine and healthcare around the globe is  
going to be dependent upon this dr nathan 
Bryan is the biochemist whose cuttingedge  
research suggests how one crucial molecule 
can impact our health brain function and  
longevity that molecule is nitric oxide nitric 
oxide is a ziggling molecule in the human body  
which regulates things like blood flow and oxygen 
delivery and the loss of nitric oxide production  
is the earliest event in the onset progression 
of age- related chronic disease so things like  
erectile dysfunction diabetes Alzheimer's high 
blood pressure which is the number one driver  
of cardiovascular disease which is the number one 
killer of men and women worldwide and 50% of the  
patients that are treated with prescription 
medication don't respond with better blood  
pressure because they aren't targeted toward 
nitric oxide but most people have never heard  
of this they don't know that if you can't walk 
up a flight of steps or exercise moderately for  
15 20 minutes then you're nitric oxide deficient 
they don't know that most toothpaste and mouthwash  
is killing the oral microbiome that's partly 
responsible for production of nitric oxide  
but no one is interested in curing human disease 
because medicine is a business and the epiphany  
for me came because my dad had a car accident and 
he developed these non-healing wounds and I saw  
the failure of the standard of care to treat dad's 
wounds and so I just thought that there had to be  
a better way and simply by giving nitric oxide 
I've healed this wound within 6 months that's  
crazy so how do I improve my nitric oxide levels 
it's what you shouldn't be doing and we'll cover  
those step by step number one you have to avoid 
this has always blown my mind a little bit 53%  
of you that listen to the show regularly haven't 
yet subscribed to the show so could I ask you for  
a favor before we start if you like the show 
and you like what we do here and you want to  
support us the free simple way that you can do 
just that is by hitting the subscribe button  
and my commitment to you is if you do that then 
I'll do everything in my power me and my team  
to make sure that this show is better for you 
every single week we'll listen to your feedback  
we'll find the guests that you want me to speak to 
and we'll continue to do what we do thank you so
much dr nathan Brian you have committed much of 
your life to writing about and educating people  
on a subject that I know absolutely nothing about 
but from doing the research for today I'm pretty  
shocked that I don't know more about this subject 
so for those people who have just clicked to  
listen to this conversation can you tell them the 
mission you're on and why it's so important yeah  
well thanks so much for having this conversation 
with me i think that illustrates the problem right  
someone as informed as you don't know anything or 
never heard of nitric oxide so it's important for  
us to just make a distinction between um like 
nitric gas that people you know inhale and that  
used if you played like uh some of those racing 
car games you press a button and the car goes  
really fast if you That's nitrous nitrous nitrous 
these are two separate things no very Yeah very  
good point so this is not nitrous oxide nitrous 
oxide is I mean a medicine is a dental anesthetic  
right it's a gas it's called laughing gas that's 
N2O that's the chemical formula what we're talking  
about is nitric oxide or NO one nitrogen one 
oxygen but yeah they sound very similar but  
they're completely different this molecule is 
is foundational for human health and longevity  
so nitric oxide is a gas it's a naturally 
produced molecule it's a signaling molecule  
in the human body and so it's it regulates 
things like blood flow and oxygen delivery  
and it mobilizes our own stem cells to help us 
recover and repair and replace dysfunctional cells  
that uh improves energy production inside the 
cell and it regulates blood flow you know when  
we begin to exercise if we want to recall memory 
that's dependent upon adequate blood flow to the  
organs if we're you know it's intimately involved 
in sexual activity and dilation of the sex organs  
for sexual function so what we're finding is 
that the older we get the less nitric oxide we  
naturally produced and now today that's recognized 
as the earliest event in the onset and progression  
of age- related chronic disease so my mission 
is to inform and educate the global population  
on how important number one what nitric oxide 
is how it's produced in the human body what  
goes wrong in people that can't make it and then 
perhaps most importantly how do we prevent that  
age related decline in nitric oxide production 
so everybody can be empowered to take control of  
their own health and prevent age related disease 
and that's what the science tells us but as you  
illustrated most people have never heard of this 
i mean this graph which I'll put on the screen for  
anyone watching kind of illustrates what you're 
talking about and quite notably this decline seems  
to start when you're 30 years old which is how 
old I am right now so well you know that's if you  
look at population based studies at different age 
groups we see about a 10 to 12% decline in what we  
call endothelial function per decade so that means 
so nitric oxide is a gas it's produced in the  
endothelium so the endothelium is the single layer 
of cells that line every blood vessel throughout  
the body so the function of these endothelial 
cells is to regulate vascular tone and to regulate  
you know solute exchange and extravisation or 
transport of molecules across that endothelial  
layer and so when your endothelial cells can no 
longer make nitric oxide gas they no longer dilate  
so the blood vessels become constricted you start 
to get inflammation you get stiff arteries plaque  
deposition and that's what starts cardiovascular 
disease or atlascerosis which So someone that's  
struggling with their nitric oxide levels at the 
moment what kind of symptoms would they experience  
well we know there's a hierarchy right so the 
first sign and symptom of nitric oxide deficiency  
is usually erectile dysfunction and when you think 
about this when we're stimulated or we're about to  
have intimacy with our partner we have to dilate 
the blood vessels so in erections in both men and  
women are dependent upon dilation of the blood 
vessels to get engorgment to get increase in  
blood flow and that's what an erection is but if 
those blood vessels can't make nitric oxide the  
blood vessels don't dilate so there's no increase 
in blood flow there's no engorgment and that's by  
definition what we call in erectile dysfunction 
and it's the same in men and women right whether  
it's the penis or the clitoris or the labia you 
have to have an increase in blood flow and without  
nitric oxide there's no increase in blood flow so 
that's number one and we call that the canary in  
the coal mine because for years people thought 
it was a lifestyle disorder right well erectile  
dysfunction yeah but now it's recognized that it's 
a symptom of loss of nitric oxide and really an  
accelerated form of cardiovascular disease so 
we have to focus on the vascular component of  
erectile dysfunction what other diseases are 
linked to nitric oxide deficiency so if if you  
don't correct the ED then what you start to 
see is an increase in blood pressure and when  
you think about this mechanistically so we have 
you know a finite volume of blood that's pumping  
throughout our body every day every second and 
if you can make nitric oxide the blood vessels  
are more dilated so now we're pumping that volume 
through you know more dilated blood vessels but if  
we lose the ability to produce nitric oxide now 
you don't get the dilation now you have smaller  
blood vessels you're pumping that same volume of 
blood through smaller pipes and simple physics  
tells us that blood pressure goes up okay so 
you're going to have cardiovascular challenges  
well you're going to have high blood pressure or 
hypertension and at least in the US and I think  
these these statistics probably are worldwide 
but two out of three Americans have an unsafe  
elevation in blood pressure and 50% of the people 
that are given prescription medications to treat  
their blood pressure do not respond with better 
blood pressure it's because most of the drugs out  
there whether they're ACE inhibitors what's 
called angotensin receptor blockers calcium  
channel antagonists the main classes of drugs 
that treat high blood pressure aren't targeted  
toward restoration of nitric oxide so that's 
why we call that resistant hypertension they're  
resistant to traditional therapies and the reason 
they're resistant is because it's a nitric oxide  
problem and those drugs aren't designed to affect 
nitric oxide production or improve it was there  
a an aha moment in your career where you became 
particularly interested in this subject because  
you could have committed your life to studying any 
facet of health or or science but for some reason  
you chose nitric oxide as the thing that you chose 
to focus on what was that eureka moment you know  
for me it was I was a student at LSU School of 
Medicine um this was the late 90s maybe early  
2000s but a Nobel Prize had just been awarded for 
the discovery of nitric oxide there were three US  
scientists that were awarded the Nobel Prize 
in physiology and medicine in 1998 and I was  
very fortunate at the time i was a young student 
probably a first year student and Lou Ignaro who  
had just won the Nobel Prize for the discovery 
of nitric oxide came and spoke and gave a lecture  
before the student body and I had a chance to 
have a conversation with him afterwards and I was  
fortunate to be invited to have dinner with him 
that night and he made a very poignant statement  
to me he goes "If we if the scientific community 
can figure out how to restore the production of  
nitric oxide it'll change the world and it'll 
change the landscape of medicine." because even  
then what is that 25 26 years ago that it was 
recognized that a loss of nitric oxide production  
is leading to the onset and development of many 
poorly managed age- related chronic diseases so I  
go that's a very profound statement from a guy 
who just won the Nobel Prize but that was the  
first kind of eureka moment for me that stimulated 
the interest but then my dad and I talk about it  
in the book is a dad is 76 years old in 1984 he 
had a car accident it left him paralyzed from the  
midback down so the majority of my life even as a 
kid I was treating dad's wounds decubitous ulcers  
pressure ulcers on his feet on his butt and he 
developed these non-healing wounds he was diabetic  
he was parapolgic poor blood flow hypertension and 
he developed a non-healing wound and no wound care  
doc that I took him to could heal this wound 
so I started making a topical nitric oxide and  
I've healed this wound within a per four years of 
non-healing i healed it within 6 months simply by  
giving nitric oxide and getting blood flow to that 
wound killing the infection in the wound and this  
was in a 60something year old paraplegic diabetic 
sedentary old man what you went through as a young  
man to me appears to be such an important sort of 
throughine with all the work that you do and chose  
to do there is this overarching question which is 
even like why did you go into medicine why did you  
want to help people where did that come from in 
you and I feel like there's clues in that to some  
degree based on what I I read about your family 
your early upbringing the divorce of your parents  
and then ultimately your dad getting in a car car 
accident and being paralyzed is that an accurate  
suspicion you know I certainly it directed kind 
of my my life because I witnessed the failure of  
the standard of care to treat dad with what I 
thought should be pretty simple i mean we have  
again the most advanced technology medical 
technology best medical schools in the world  
and yet we can't treat a wound we can't address 
the hypertension we can't address the diabetes  
medically and so I just thought that there had to 
be a better way it's still with you now isn't it
yeah but I you know I see um you know dad when 
think I'm having a bad day i just think look I'm  
not in a wheelchair i got my health so no matter 
how bad I think I got it it could always be worse  
so I just wake up every day with a grateful 
heart and you know some days are good some days  
are bad but I always realize it could always be 
better but it could be a hell of a lot worse so  
I don't complain and who are you what are all the 
reference points what's the experience you've had  
in your career that have filled up your sort of 
buckets of knowledge that you bring forth today  
like what what have you studied where have you 
been i was in molecular and cellular physiology  
got a PhD in molecular and cellular physiology and 
that was I was recruited by Fred Murad one of the  
other guys who shared the Nobel Prize to join the 
faculty at the University of Texas Health Science  
Center in Houston which is the world's largest 
medical center but it's part of the University of  
Texas system so I was recruited as a professor of 
molecular medicine published probably well over a  
hundred peer-reviewed scientific publications i've 
edited several medical textbooks on the subject  
i taught in medical school and then I resigned 
from academia I guess several years ago uh  
during COVID to focus on the next phase of my 
career is taking this 25 years of science and  
research and discovery and now bringing that 
to the four for safe and effective product  
technology drug therapies to eradicate a lot of 
these poorly managed chronic diseases that you  
know we're faced with today so let me get this 
straight i'll repeat back to you what I think I  
understand about nitric oxide and you tell me if 
it's accurate so this nitric oxide is a chemical  
that is in all the blood cells of my body and 
it allows my blood cells to basically expand  
open up so blood can flow through there so if I 
it dilates it dilates the smooth muscle so it's  
not affecting the cells per se but it's dilating 
the smooth muscle that surrounds the blood vessels  
that leads to relaxation and dilation fine so my 
blood cells would then expand your blood vessels  
and more blood would go through there but if 
I'm deficient that mechanism doesn't work and  
my blood cells wouldn't expand ultimately expand 
through the relaxation of the muscles that's right  
and therefore I would have higher blood pressure 
which can lead to a series of downstream diseases  
and consequences and so when we look at the graph 
that I showed a second ago where we're seeing for  
anyone that can't see this graph because you're 
listening on audio we're seeing nitric oxide  
levels in young people up to the age of roughly 
around 20 are optimal and then from about 30 to  
70 there's this tremendous sort of 80 90% drop 
when I look at that graph though my question  
becomes is that not just aging is that not just 
normal is that not just inevitable well yeah  
there are a lot of things that occur with aging 
right we lose growth hormone with age we lose  
u you know many hormones uh nitric oxide is a 
is a hormone that we we first discovered nitric  
oxide as a hormone back in 2007 but to understand 
aging you have to understand what leads to aging  
so aging from my perspective is the inability to 
repair and replace dysfunctional cells right every  
day we wear ourselves out and we just got to and 
if we can repair and replace dysfunctional cells  
then we combat or at least prolong the aging 
process so what the science tells us in nitric  
oxide is this that loss of nitric oxide production 
is the earliest event in the onset progression of  
age- related chronic disease so as that graph 
implies it is part of the aging process but it  
doesn't have to be right because today we know we 
can shift that curve to the left or to the right  
so we can accelerate it and you see this today 
with 18 20 year old kids that are have high blood  
pressure they have diabetes they have erectile 
dysfunction they have learning and and cognitive  
uh impairment and those are all symptoms of nitric 
oxide deficiency and to the contrary we if we see  
50 60 70 year old patients that would fit on a 
30 or 40 year old scale on that graph so this  
this doesn't have to be the case we know how to 
prevent this age- related decline in nitric oxide  
production you know I'm I'm the best example i'm 
51 years old but I've got the vascular age of a  
36 year old because I employ these principles 
to prevent this age- related decline in nitric  
oxide production and when you say you've got 
the vascular age of a 36-y old how how does  
one measure that you look at the sort of vascular 
health of your You can So there's there's several  
objective measures of of biological age obviously 
we can affect our chronological age right but  
we can certainly affect our biological age so 
what you can do there's databases now of what  
we call croted inima media thickness so they 
take an ultrasound and look at your corroted  
arteries and they can look at what's called smooth 
muscle hyperlasia or the thickness of the inima  
and compare it to a database of age matched 
kind of really it's you're comparing against  
your colleagues so that's one way another way is 
looking at what's called flow mediated dilitation  
or endothelial function and again through 
database of hundreds of thousands or millions of  
patients you can figure out where you fall on that 
spectrum on endothelial function and then there's  
um you know other mark markers looking at histone 
modification of the DNA methylation profiles  
there's a company or technology called glyen age 
that looks at certain markers uh that can then  
define a biological age for each individual so 
by age 40 we have lost about 50% of our ability  
to produce nitric oxide in our blood vessels and 
we lose 10 to 12% of nitric oxide production per  
decade this is all according to your book and 
by age 70 to 80 nitric oxide levels in blood  
vessels can be 75% lower than in young adults a 
Japanese study found a 75% reduction in nitric  
oxide production in people aged 70 to 80 compared 
to 20 year olds interesting so in terms of chronic  
disease that is downstream from me losing nitric 
oxide level can you give me a bit of a menu  
of chronic disease that is associated with this 
nitric oxide deficiency yep we've touched on them  
so erectile dysfunction um 50% of the men over the 
age of 40 self-report erectile dysfunction that's  
in the US so think about that 50% self-report 
i think the numbers are higher because most 40  
year olds that I know are never going to admit 
that they have erectile dysfunction so I think  
the numbers are even worse so that's one high 
blood pressure again 50% of the patients that  
are treated with prescription medication don't 
respond with better blood pressure that's a huge  
problem because high blood pressure is the number 
one driver of cardiovascular disease which is the  
number one killer of men and women worldwide 
number three metabolic disease and diabetes  
we published in 2011 that nitric oxide production 
is necessary for insulin signaling if the cell  
can't make nitric oxide you develop insulin 
resistance so diabetes a global pandemic nine out  
of 10 Americans are metabolically unfit the other 
thing is exercise intolerance if you if you try to  
start an exercise regimen and you can't walk up 
a flight of steps or exercise moderately for 15  
20 30 minutes then you're nitric oxide deficient 
and then the other one is uh obviously Alzheimer's  
because Alzheimer's is a vascular disease it's 
reduced blood flow to the uh to the brain we call  
focal eskemia there's insulin resistance you know 
Alzheimer's has been called diabetes type three so  
you can't get it glucose into the cell that's the 
primary energy source or substrate of the brain  
oxidative stress and immune dysfunction and then 
you get um misfolded proteins and that shows up  
as the tangles and the amaloid plaque that we see 
in Alzheimer's patients so if we can restore and  
nitric oxide corrects every single thing we know 
about Alzheimer's it improves blood flow to the  
brain it improves glucose uptake so it overcomes 
the metabolic aspect of Alzheimer's it reduces  
inflammation in fact a number of my patents are 
on a method of reducing inflammation it inhibits  
the oxidative stress we see in in Alzheimer's and 
neurological disease and it prevents the immune  
dysfunction and when you do that when you restore 
blood flow and you get nutrients and oxygen in and  
you take out the metabolic waste products there's 
no misfolding of protein so you don't get the  
amaloid plaque you don't get the tangles so this 
simple molecule nitric oxide gas I'm absolutely  
convinced will eradicate and cure Alzheimer's 
really because it it addresses every physiological  
root cause of Alzheimer's if you can get it 
administered therapeutically to patients early  
enough or no I think that's a very key because the 
success or failure of any clinical trial any drug  
in any clinical trial is dependent upon the design 
of the clinical trial and what patients at what  
stage of disease that you enroll these patients 
so what are the inclusion criteria and what are  
the exclusion criteria and there's a stage in 
every disease whether it's heart disease kidney  
disease Alzheimer's where you've reached a point 
of no return there's really no medical therapy  
that's going to reverse that disease because 
it's progressed to a state that's irreversible  
so I think what we try to do is take take 
patients early in the process what we call  
vascular dementia mild cognitive impairment early 
Alzheimer's because what I want to be able to  
demonstrate is two things number one can we stop 
the progression of disease once it's started can  
we stop the progression and then number two is we 
want to enroll patients far enough along to where  
we can show regression so can you move can you 
move the needle back and so That's a very kind of  
a specific and finite patient population when you 
design a clinical study number one at the at the  
absolute worst we want to stop progression at the 
absolute best we want to show that we can regress  
disease and that's the goal of therapy is that you 
understand the mechanism of disease to the extent  
that you can treat it you can prevent it you can 
reverse it and you can cure it is there something  
you believe that the traditional world of medicine 
and maybe the traditional media don't believe  
yeah I believe in the truth and I come from a very 
objective scientific background so everything that  
we do is based on objective uh data i say this 
because I was listening to your interview before  
and there were several moments in the interview 
where you'd reference that you'd say things like  
they don't they don't want you to know this or 
they don't they won't tell you this no absolutely  
because you know the we talk about epiphies and 
eureka moments in science but for me one of the  
kind of complete change in paradigm in the way 
that I think was changed in when I was in academia  
and teaching in medical school and doing research 
in in an academic institution and you start to  
think what we in the scientific community we un 
we've cured every disease every disease known  
to man we've cured it in rats and mice so then the 
question is why isn't this translated into patient  
care why can't we do this in humans number one in 
in animal experiments we control their environment  
we control their food we control their life 
cycle we control everything about them you  
can't do that in everybody has a different diet 
everybody has different drug therapy that they're  
on or hygienic practices but then what I realized 
was because when I was in academia we wanted to  
create this consortium a center of excellence for 
diseases because my thought process was you know  
western medicine is siloed right if you have a 
heart problem you go to a cardiologist you've  
got a GI problem you go to gastronurologist if you 
got a neurological problem you go to a neurologist  
or psychiatrist but none of these disciplines talk 
to one another so if you go to that neurologist is  
going to treat that condition much different than 
the cardiologist would much different than the GI  
doc would but what if we're looking at the exact 
same root cause and so my philosophy well let's  
create a center of excellence and let's bring 
everybody in the room let's bring the GI docs the  
the neurologists the cardiologists the geneticists 
the pulmonary docs the kidney docs the renal docs  
and let's let's understand this kind of wheel and 
cog because everything occurs at the mitochondria  
subcellular level and energy production and then 
basically everything can can manifest from that  
but what I quickly realized when you when you go 
to for instance MD Anderson and trying to treat  
cancer no one is interested in curing cancer 
no one is interested in curing human disease  
because the epiphany for me came because medicine 
is a business it's a for-profit business in fact  
it's the largest business and economic model in 
the world trillion dollar annualized market and  
most of these drug companies who influence and pay 
and support scientific journals JAMAMA New England  
Journal of Medicine the major publications the 
major journals and they're influencing regulation  
and policy and FDA and so when you figure out 
that there's undue influence by these for-profit  
companies because the number one rule of business 
as you know as an entrepreneur and a business guy  
is acquire a customer and keep that customer as 
long as you can call it lifetime value of that  
customer and that's what medicine is they get you 
they you acquire you as a customer they put you on  
a drug that drug has side effects they have to put 
you on another drug to mitigate the side effects  
of that drug now you got side effects from that 
polyarm pharmacy they have to put you on another  
drug to mitigate those side effects and now you 
look up and people who are 50 to 60 years old and  
older are on 10 12 18 different medications 
that's the best financial model in the world  
so it's a great financial model but it's at the 
expense of our health and the health of everybody  
living on in the world and in the US you know we 
have the sickest population in the world now for  
the first time in the history of western medicine 
have discussions between physician and patient how  
do we wean you off this drug that conversation 
has never had before because it's always if this  
doesn't work come back and I'll prescribe you 
more drugs let's do the opposite you come back  
and let's understand the root of cause of disease 
let's say okay well if we are addressing this you  
don't need this medication and if you don't need 
this medication you don't need this medication and  
now for the first time you start weaning patients 
off of drugs and what happens you're now impeding  
upon the market share of these multi-billion 
dollar drug companies who make their living  
buying influence regulating policy influencing 
policy and the FDA is a stepping stone to a board  
seat of big pharma every former FDA official in 
the US for the past 20 or 30 years goes on to  
become multi-million dollar salaried employee from 
big pharma it has to stop despite spending nearly  
20% of the United States GDP on healthcare the 
US ranks last overall on health outcomes among  
high income countries including having the highest 
infant mortality rates and lowest life expectancy  
it's like unbelievable no I mean that's that's 
depressing i mean but those are the facts and  
the you have to understand those those are 
indisputable data right and so when people hear  
that they go they this but when you look at kind 
of the system and I don't blame doctors because  
doctors are get into this field you know I was on 
the admissions committee to UT medical school for  
a number of years so we interviewed a lot of these 
young kids figure out what their motivation was  
will they have a successful career in medicine 
and almost everyone I mean there's always the  
exception but everyone gets into medicine 
because they want to make make a difference  
they're driven by curiosity and most of them want 
to leave a lasting legacy and help people that's  
what drives uh entry into healthcare but when you 
look at the system in which they're trained in it  
prevents them it basically handcuffs them because 
when you figure out the pay the economic model of  
medicine once you make a diagnosis now you've 
got a diagnosible disease to which you have a  
finite number of responses right if you make this 
diagnosis that's called an ICD10 code which is  
reimburseable and that's how you get paid so once 
you make a diagnosis you only have a finite list  
of things you can do you can't ask that question 
and go well what's really causing this and spend  
you know 90 minutes with that patient because most 
physicians have to see 60 70 80 patients a day to  
pay the bills to cover their overhead so it's a 
factory you come in you look at you've got a a  
transcriber you make a diagnosis okay I can I'm 
going to prescribe this medication come back in  
two weeks or six months and we'll see where you 
are and then it's just it's a term it's a meal  
but as you me the data don't lie right sickest 
population highest infant mortality in the most  
industrialized nation in the world and according 
to the data Americans are spending about 13 years  
of their life living with disease and that is 
significantly higher than many other highincome  
western countries so although life expectancy 
you know might be 70 80 years old you're going  
to spend almost 15 years of that time living with 
disease so your health span is um really probably  
the more important thing to be focusing on not 
your lifespan and so when we talk about nitric  
oxide I've heard you describe it as the molecule 
of longevity for sure why why' you say that why do  
you say that well again longevity is this emerging 
field that's driven by how do we live longer how  
do we increase our health span and longevity right 
because I think we can all agree that nobody wants  
to live to be 100 years old if we spend the last 
25 of that years incapacitated in a diaper unable  
to get out of bed right that's not living so when 
I look at longevity I look at kind of what are the  
hallmarks of longevity what defines longevity 
right how do we live longer healthier life free  
of disease and really there's three objective 
measures there is a stem cells you know this  
whole field of regenerative medicine is based 
on mobilizing our own stem cells or deploying  
u stem cells throughout the body to repair and 
replace dysfunctional cells so these stem cells  
are cells that can basically act as like band-aids 
repairs for any part of our body well we call them  
pur potent stem cells so mean that and some of 
these are bone marrow derived some of these are  
what we call stromal vascular fraction that you 
get from the atapost tissue or the fat pur potent  
would mean pur potent means they can that stem 
cell can go and become a neuron that stem cell  
can go to the heart and become a functional meioy 
it can go and become a macrofase or an immune cell  
white blood cell so pur potent means it can become 
many things whatever it needs to be in some cases  
the amount of stem cells present in our bone 
marrow get smaller with age the number of cells  
decrease with age but fortunately or unfortunately 
the older we get the more fat we deposit and so  
we have a number of stem cells in our fat so we 
increase the number of stem cells in our fat so  
the problem with aging and longevity is when we 
lose the ability to mobilize our own stem cells  
we can't we can't repair and replace dysfunctional 
cells so we have these what we call zombie cells  
or scinsesscent cells they're there but they 
can't do their job they're dysfunctional and  
that's what leads to age number two it's telomeirs 
and telomeirs are the ends of the chromosomes of  
our DNA and so the they're the very end so it's 
like the um the the tips of the sho strings  
right that prevent the sho string from fraying 
and those are like the telomeir so as long as  
you have a functional telomeir and it prevents 
it from getting shorter then shorter telomeir  
shorter lifespan longer telomeres longer lifespan 
so when telomeirs get shorter it decreases our  
lifespan and longevity and then the third one is 
mitochondrial function every age- related chronic  
disease you have a lower number of mitochondria 
per cell and the mitochondria that are present  
aren't functional so you get a what's called an 
uncoupling of the electron transport chain inside  
the inner mitochondrial membrane and you can no 
longer effectively produce cellular energy or ATP  
so nitric oxide is the foundational longevity 
longevity molecule because nitric oxide is the  
signal in the body that tells our stem cells to 
mobilize and differentiate without nitric oxide  
you have less number of circulating stem cells 
nitric oxide activates the enzyme toase which  
prevents telomeir shortening without nitric oxide 
you don't get activation of tomeorase telomeir  
shorten and then nitric oxide is the signal in the 
cell that tells the cell I need more mitochondria  
and I need these mitochondria to be more efficient 
generate more cellular energy with less oxygen so  
when you when you restore nitric oxide you address 
all three aspects of longevity and there's no  
other molecule on the body that does that you know 
Brian Johnson don't you yes what do you think of  
Brian Johnson you know I would never replicate 
or try to um do what he does i don't think it's  
the proper approach you know and I I don't I don't 
mean to criticize people because this whole field  
of biohacking you know you get people who have 
no science background no medical background no  
biochemical background and yet they're out there 
influencing millions of people that follow them  
and many times they're giving really bad advice 
not intentionally it's because of ignorance they  
just don't know they don't know the science they 
don't know the medicine behind it so before you  
go and follow any influencer or biohacker number 
one look at their credentials and if they don't  
have any science background if they're you know 
formal technologist or you know come from anything  
besides science and medicine you really need to 
do a little bit of deep dive and make sure that  
what they're giving you is scientifically valid 
or recommending he seems to be a fan of um the  
role of nitric oxide as it relates to longevity 
though he seems to have said positive things about  
um nitric oxide and its impact on improving 
your cardiovascular health yeah i think as  
we advance the science and we we do more to 
communicate the complex science into you know  
layman's terms where the the non-scientists 
non-medical professionals can understand it  
and appreciate it i think more people are going to 
pick up to that but there's also some well-known  
biohackers with influences of you know millions 
of people that still say that nitric oxide is a  
toxin that inhibits mitochondrial respiration and 
it should be avoided is there such thing as having  
too much nitric oxide though because if people 
hear this conversation today and they rush out  
and they I don't know overdo their nitric oxide by 
doing a bunch of uh therapies yeah is that a risk  
absolutely you know we know water is essential 
right but we can drink too much water and kill  
ourselves you see it on the news you know a couple 
times a year called hypotonic lis so yeah dose  
dictates poison and so what we have to do is make 
sure maintain the integrity of the field to make  
sure that if there are nitric oxide products out 
there that number one you don't overdo it and and  
lead to you know health issues or kill a consumer 
kill a patient that could kill the entire field  
but we also understand that there's only two signs 
of toxicity for nitric oxide so it's really pretty  
straightforward number one if you take too much 
nitric oxide you're going to get an unsafe drop  
in blood pressure because think about this if 
you if you take nitric oxide or you're enhancing  
nitric oxide production through whatever means 
it's going to lead to systemic vasoddilation now  
you've got that same volume of blood pumping 
through much larger pipes and you're going  
to have a drop in blood pressure and if you lose 
profusion pressure you're not going to be able to  
peruse the brain because you got to pump against 
gravity and you're going to get lightheaded and  
you'll pass out and if that's prolonged it leads 
to es schemic end organ damage and organ failure  
and it can be deadly so that's number one 
and then number two is a condition called  
met hemoglobinia and that's a big word meaning 
that your it oxidizes the iron of hemoglobin and  
reduces your oxygen carrying capacity so you'll 
become cyanotic you'll get blue around the lips  
your extremities will turn will turn um you 
know white from lack of profusion or lack of  
oxygen but you never see that I mean you really 
never see clinical met hemoglobinia fortunately  
your your blood pressure will drop to an unsafe 
level long before you get any accumulation of met  
hemoglobinia so on this point of longevity then 
one of the points you mentioned there was telmir  
length and I've heard about telmir length because 
I've heard about studies they've done in rats and  
I think other rodents around telmir length so 
it was discovered that indiv individuals with  
shorter telomeres had a death rate nearly twice 
of those with longer telomeres and you're telling  
me that there has been research done that 
shows how nitric oxide can increase telmir  
length absolutely so we we understand at the DNA 
level at the nuclear level that nitric oxide is  
is what's called a collocicalizes with estrogen 
recep receptor to allow for the turning the the  
cell to turn on transcription and translation of 
the tomeorase enzyme so it's not only affecting  
the genetic transcription of that protein but 
it's also regulating the function of the enzyme  
so without nitric oxide you have less telomeir 
tomeorase enzyme and that tomeorase enzyme isn't  
functional okay so nitric oxide has an impact on 
the tomease tomeorase enzyme that's right tomeres  
enzyme so what happens with each cellular division 
those telomeirs can get shorter right but as long  
as that tomeorase enzyme is active it prevents the 
shortening of the very ends of the chromosome okay  
and just for people that don't understand the um 
with every replication as we age we're continually  
replicating ourselves to restore and repair them 
but in that replication process harm is occurred  
sometimes yeah and different cell types have 
different replication rates right so the the  
epithelium of the gut is highly regenerative right 
it's it's a replicatable uh you replacing these  
cells all the time because it's the outside 
environment that you're having to continue  
to replace those cells neurons to the exact 
opposite aren't regenerative by nature so we don't  
typically make I mean we can it was once thought 
that you can't regenerate neurons but today we  
know we can but yeah so it affects different organ 
systems differently but the data are clear shorter  
telomeres shorter lifespan the other thing that 
um I wanted to talk to you about before we really  
get into the heart of how do I improve my nitric 
oxide levels keep them at a healthy range while I  
age is nitric oxide's relationship with the oral 
microbiome i had a conversation on this podcast  
not too long ago about the oral microbiome again 
another subject I hadn't thought much about but  
is there a relationship there no doubt i mean 
this is this is probably 20 year old science  
um where we find that you know probably 20 years 
ago the microbiome project was complete and what  
that means is that the bacteria that live in and 
on our body were completely mapped out and these  
communities were identified in the gut started in 
the gut the gastrointestinal tract and then you  
know you can you can culture the the this the skin 
flora there's bacteria that live on our skin there  
are bacteria that live in our colon there are 
bacteria in women that that that reside in the in  
the vagina and so all of these different ecologies 
of bacteria that live in and on the body are there  
to do things to help the human host right we 
call this symbiosis we're providing benefit to  
the bacteria and the bacteria providing benefit 
to the human host and so if you use antibiotics  
or antiseptics to kill the bacteria that live 
in and on our body you get human disease i mean  
that's clear and the the best example is that 
there's no physician in the world that would  
recommend you or I take an antibiotic every day 
for the rest of our lives right do you agree with  
that and why is that because the antibiotics are 
killing the good bacteria they kill the infectious  
pathogen bacteria but they also destroy 
the entire microbiome and when you disrupt  
the microbiome you get systemic disease you get 
vascular disease you get Alzheimer's you get uh  
leaky gut syndrome you get autoimmune disease you 
get high blood pressure you get yeast infections  
uh you get overgrowth of candida you get parasites 
so the bacteria are really the police of the human  
kind of surveillance right so the n we have 10 
times more bacteria cells that make up the human  
than we have human cells so we're 10 times more 
bacteria than we are human and so if you destroy  
that microbiome then it leads to systemic disease 
we live in a culture where we're constantly trying  
to kill bacteria right like especially post 
pandemic we're using all kinds of hand washes  
and antiseptics and obviously the the big I 
guess chemicals that we all typically use are  
things like mouthwashes with uh which are again 
trying to just clean out all the bacteria from  
our mouths what how would you caution someone 
on using these things and even the like the  
antibacterial Yeah it's bad news really we give 
it to our children because we want our kids to  
be clean and not to have kids need to be dirty 
you find and again you look at epidemological  
data peop kids who grow up in the in a rural area 
they're out in the environment they're rolling in  
dirt they're they're got dirt on them and they 
have um you know they're inoculated with a lot  
of bacterium those kids are the healthiest people 
and and you look later in life they have lower  
incidence of cardiovascular disease diabetes they 
have better immune dysfunction less autoimmune  
disease so there's this whole hy hygienic 
principle or hygienic hypothesis of disease  
and I don't think it's a hypothesis anymore i 
think it's proven out so for me I go back and I  
go "What why are we doing this why are we using 
fluoride rinses in dental offices why is there  
fluoride in our toothpaste why is there fluoride 
in the municipal water of 72% of municipalities in  
the US when fluoride is a known antiseptic it's a 
chemical toxicant it's a a thyroid toxic it kills  
your thyroid and it's a neurological toxin." And 
so when you go back and look at the history of  
dentistry over a hundred years ago it was first 
identified that oral bacteria can be found in  
the plaque that killed someone from an acute 
heart attack right people who died from sudden  
cardiac death they'll take the thrombus or the 
embleis that oluded that coronary artery and they  
basically biops it and they find oral bacteria in 
that plaque that caused the heart attack or stroke  
so that told us there's an oral systemic 
link there's bacterial transllocation of the  
pathogens that's why bleeding gums are a problem 
because you've got bacteria in the mouth if you  
got bleeding gums there's open blood vessels for 
those bacteria to get into our blood supply now  
they become systemic cause inflammation plaque 
rupture and heart attack and stroke so 100 years  
ago with reason with good reason they go well 
let's treat with an aneseptic we have to kill all  
the bacteria in the mouth so if you have bleeding 
gums there's no translloca transllocation of that  
in the systemic circulation and we can prevent 
heart attack or stroke that was a hundred years  
ago and we've learned a lot in those hundred 
years number one it wasn't recognized that we  
have a microbiome on our body in our body so now 
when I ask dentists all the time why do you use  
floor and they go well it's been used for hundred 
years and I go I don't care what the question is  
that's the worst answer you could provide just 
because we're doing it because that's the way  
we've always done it right so now we have 
to understand how do we selectively kill the  
pathogens while maintaining a healthy microbiome 
and so this this field started probably in the  
I mean some of the first papers were published 
probably in the 90s showing that there were if  
you use mouthwash it destroyed the microbiome 
and we saw an increase in blood pressure these  
papers were published in the late 2000s we we 
published on this probably in like 2008 2009  
we created what's called an association so people 
who had the healthiest and most diverse bacteria  
in their mouth had the best blood pressure people 
who had the least diverse oral microbiome and we  
we could not culture any of these nitric oxide 
producing bacteria appeared to have the highest  
blood pressure so that's what we call association 
it's not causation but it's a nice association  
so in 2019 we published a paper showing okay 
let's now let's see if we do if we take normal  
intensive patients young healthy people with good 
nitric oxide good blood pressure and we just give  
them mouthwash twice a day for seven days to kill 
the entire oral microbiome and then we do tongue  
scrapings to see if we're killing the bacteria 
and we do blood pressure measurements and so we  
do that twice a day for seven days seven days 
we bring them back in we measure their blood  
pressure and then we stop for four days we say 
okay don't talk don't take mouthwash for four  
days then come back let's rememeasure your blood 
pressure and let's do tongue scrapings and figure  
out what's happening to this these bacterial 
communities and what we found was that if you  
eradicate the bacteria within 7 days your blood 
pressure goes up so if you use mouthwash within  
seven days your blood pressure goes up i think it 
occurs earlier but what we we looked at seven days  
we only looked at day one at baseline seven days 
and then four days after stopping the mouthwash  
but in one 21-year-old kid his blood pressure went 
up 26 millimeters of mercury which is put that in  
context for me that's clinically hypertensive so 
for every 1 millimeter increase in blood pressure  
that increases your risk of cardiovascular 
disease by 1% so within 7 days we increased  
this kid's risk of cardiovascular disease by 26% 
simply by giving him mouthwash and explain to me  
in layman's terms the mechanism there what's 
going on well we're still trying to understand  
mechanism again we're at the observational level 
that's really indisputable because these bacteria  
there's what we call nitrate reducing bacteria 
and humans do not have this enzyme so nitrate  
is what's found in green leafy vegetables right 
these these plants assimilate nitrogen in the  
soil in the form of nitrate we consume these 
vegetables the nitrate is taken up in the gut  
it's concentrated in our salivary glands and the 
bacteria perform this metabolism of nitrate into  
nitrite and nitric oxide and humans do not have 
the the functional enzyme to do this so we're  
100% dependent upon the bacteria so then now 
because nitrate is inert in humans we we rely  
on the bacteria to metabolize this molecule into a 
usable form where we can make nitric oxide so when  
you're killing the bacterium now the nitrate is 
just being recirculated but you're you're you're  
urinating because it's it's it's filtered across 
the kidneys you poop it out and you sweat it out  
so it's completely unchanged unless you have the 
right bacteria and what we're finding is that that  
oral production of nitride and nitric oxide 
being produced in the acid environment of the  
stomach is somehow regulating resistance arteries 
in dilation to normalize systemic blood pressure  
so if I don't have a healthy oral microbiome then 
you have an elevation in blood pressure and much  
of the things you you're talking to me about 
today in terms of dietary um changes won't have  
any effect anyway because I need the bacteria 
to convert it into nitric oxide as it relates  
there are many benefits of of many nutrients 
in foods particular plants that confer some  
health benefits but when we focus specifically 
on the benefits of nitric oxide from your diet  
if you don't have the right oral bacteria you 
get zero nitric oxide benefits from your diet  
now you're going to get you know obviously 
hopefully vitamin A vitamin C vitamin D from  
foods fiber other phytonutrients but in terms 
of the blood pressure lowering effects of a for  
instance a plant-based diet if you don't have the 
right bacteria you get zero benefits of that have  
you seen a link between oral health and cancer 
yes absolutely what have you seen people that  
have dental infections root canals cavitations 
from previous extraction sites have typically  
cancer it sets the stage for cancer cell growth 
and proliferation so and and I've you know I made  
a controversial statement on a on a previous 
podcast where I say number one I'm not an  
oncologist but people who have terminal metastatic 
disease who aren't ready to die who are sent home  
to die on hospice somehow find me and go can you 
help me with this cancer and so the first thing  
I always send them to is a dentist to see do you 
have any active oral infections that may have led  
to the development of the primary tumor in the 
first place but obviously it's it's metastatic  
meaning that it's now everywhere it's it's it's 
migrated outside that primary tumor but almost  
always without fail they have an active oral 
infection and it may be a symptomatic infection  
to where they know it and they have a toothache 
or it may be an asymptomatic infection where they  
don't even know they got a dental infection what 
percentage of cancer patients that you see that  
you then refer to a dentist have an oral infection 
people with primary tumors solid tumors so we  
categorize these in bloodborne cancers something 
like lymphoma leukemia multiple myoma which is  
a bloodborne cancer and those that have a solid 
tumor a primary tumor that starts in the breast  
the colon the prostate the lungs or the liver 
without fail 100% of them have dental infections  
but cause and effect is not possible to establish 
here right because cause and effect no I don't  
think we're there yet i think probably as the 
science advances and people start to look at  
this because you may imagine if you have cancer 
and you've been to the best cancer doctors in the  
world and you've done surgery you've done chemo 
you've done radiation you've gone through the  
standard of care and the cancer comes back 
it's terminal it's metastatic and you tell  
when I tell people well you need to go see a 
dentist i mean many people laugh and they go  
"Have you what what in the hell did you just say 
i've got cancer i don't have a dental problem."  
And I go "Well perhaps you do." Because again 
if you go back and always look at back what's  
what's held true throughout ages and if you look 
at ayurveetic medicine if you look at traditional  
Chinese medicine if you look at acupuncture you 
know if you go back and you look if you don't  
know what to look for you're never going to find 
it if you know what to look for it's out there  
it's in the published literature but every tooth 
in the body is connected to an organ system right  
and so these are these are the meridians the 
acupuncture meridians you know the analogy is  
they're circuit breakers so if you if you trip a 
breaker in your home there's no electricity going  
through that circuit so your oven doesn't work 
your refrigerator doesn't work or your lights go  
out well the body is electric right and how do we 
diagnose death no electrical activity right either  
through an EKG or an EEG so the body is electric 
and we're we're batteries and so if we get if that  
red light comes on on our phone it says we have 
a low battery everybody panics and goes and plugs  
it in and charges right and the human body is 
the exact same we lose voltage over time and if  
you've got a trip breaker from an infected tooth 
there's no voltage there's no circuitry going to  
that meridian that feeds individual organs so the 
the best example is if you've got a root canal  
and a 100% of root canal teeth are infected and 
when you think and people go well that's not true  
well think about what a root canal is you had a 
toothache at some point because of an infection  
so you go to the dentist and they pull the nerve 
root out of that tooth so you don't feel the pain  
anymore because there's no nerve root there and 
they pull the blood supply out of that tooth now  
you have no blood supply to that tooth and a tooth 
is a crystallin structure it's a living organ with  
no blood supply and no nerve root that's a dead 
tissue so if you were to go in and we'd disconnect  
your gallbladder for example and just cut the 
blood supply to it the nerve supply to it within  
seven or 10 days you'd be dead from sepsis nobody 
leaves dead tissue in the body and so then what  
happens is when you leave the dentist what do they 
do they put you on an oral antibiotic but they  
must have forgotten they took out the blood supply 
to that infected site so an oral antibiotic isn't  
going to reach the sight of infection i mean to me 
when you think when you sit back and think about  
this and go who the hell does this and why do they 
do it well it's because what we've always done  
so then what happens is these anorobic bacteria 
they don't need oxygen they're sitting there in  
an anorobic low oxygen environment and they're 
just eating away at your jawline they're just  
like us do they they they metabolize they take 
stuff in they poop waste out those waste products  
uh accumulate it shuts down voltage and they eat 
away at your jawline so then you've got osteom  
necrosis osteomiitis and you don't even know it 
and an x-ray will not show it and most dentists  
unfortunately still use x-rays instead of a higher 
resolution CT it's really interesting i was doing  
some research in preparation for this conversation 
around this subject of oral microbiome and cancer  
and the link there and one particular study that 
was done um published in the New York Post but  
done by a team of researchers found that this 
was done at New York University as well so it  
was published by the New York Post and done at 
New York University they analyzed saliva samples  
of over 160,000 participants over 15 years are you 
familiar with this study and they identified over  
a dozen bacteria species linked to a high risk 
of head and neck cancers with certain bacteria  
increasing the risk by 50% of getting a cancer 
which is pretty shocking um literally I feel  
like texting my assistant and asking us to book 
a oral hygieneist and to change my mouthwash no  
matter where I am in the world it seems like 
everyone is drinking matcha and there's a good  
chance that that matcha you're drinking is made 
by a company that I've invested more than seven  
figures in who are a sponsor of this podcast 
called Perfect Ted because they're the brand  
used globally by cafes like Blank Street Coffee 
and Joe in the Juice and many many more not only  
can you get Perfect Ted Match in cafes but you 
can now also make it at home much cheaper in  
seconds using our flavored matcha powders that 
I have here in front of me perfect Ted matcher  
is ceremonial grade and sourced from Japan it 
is smooth it is naturally sweet not like those  
bitter grassy matches that I tried before perfect 
Ted and if you are one of those people that have  
told yourself you don't like matcha it's probably 
because you haven't tried our Perfect Ted Matcher  
and you can find Perfect Ted Matcher in the 
UK in Tesco Sainsbury's Holland and Barrett

Steven40 this one change has transformed how my 
team and I move train and think about our bodies  
when Dr daniel Lieberman came on the diio he 
explained how modern shoes with their cushioning  
and support are making our feet weaker and less 
capable of doing what nature intended them to do  
we've lost the natural strength and mobility in 
our feet and this is leading to issues like back  
pain and knee pain i'd already purchased a pair 
of Viva barefoot shoes so I showed them to Daniel  
Lieberman and he told me that they were exactly 
the type of shoe that would help me restore  
natural foot movement and rebuild my strength 
but I think it was planttoicitis that I had where  
suddenly my feet started hurting all the time 
and after that I decided to start strengthening  
my own foot by using the Vivo barefoots and 
research from Liverpool University has backed  
this up they've shown that wearing Vivo barefoot 
shoes for 6 months can increase foot strength  
by up to 60% visit vivarefoot.com/doac 
and use code DOAC20 for 20% off that's a
vivobarefoot.com/dac use code DOAC20 a strong body 
starts with strong feet if I've just listened to  
everything you've just said there and I want 
to improve my oral microbiome what should I  
be doing well I think the most important thing 
we've learned is what you shouldn't be doing  
right so it's not what should we do it's what 
we shouldn't be doing number one we have to get  
rid of fluoride you know just this past weekend I 
was speaking at a dental conference in Salt Lake  
City and there were there people there from 
the National Toxicology Program which in the  
US is the organization tasked with if there's any 
kind of risk of exposure of environmental toxicant  
they're charged with doing the toxicology studies 
to see if there's an increased risk what is the  
risk and is there a safe level that is without 
risk and what they report is that fluoride there's  
no benefit of fluoride and it's all risk it lowers 
IQ in kids by as much as seven points and it shuts  
down your thyroid function and it's a neurotoxin 
and as I mentioned before most toothpaste has  
fluoride in it and if you read the back of your 
toothpaste it will tell you at least in the US  
I don't know about in other countries but it 
says if you swallow this call poison control  
because it's a poison they're putting poison in 
toothpaste and then if you also pay attention  
it says only put a P-siz amount of toothpaste on 
your toothbrush a P size but everybody that I know  
fills the entire bristle of the toothpaste with 
toothbrush with toothpaste so that's about 10 or  
15 sometimes 20 P-size amounts of toothpaste and 
a P-siz amount of toothpaste contains about half  
a milligram of fluoride now if you're using 10 
20 times more than that P size now you're exposed  
to 5 milligrams 10 milligrams of fluoride and you 
don't even have to swallow it this is a very small  
molecule a molecular weight of 19 so it's absorbed 
directly across the bugal mucosa the oral cavity  
and it becomes systemic i'm not going to use it 
anymore no you shouldn't what should I use instead  
you have to use a non florinated toothpaste 
and what about things like tongue scrapers  
now tongue scrapers the data again that's time- 
tested that's an ancient practice and even in  
our study we found that people who do tongue 
scraping have a more diverse oral microbiome and  
they seem to have better oral health why is this 
my girlfriend's been banging on to me she's always  
bloody right my girlfriend's been banging on to me 
about tongue scraping for the last two years and  
I've kind of just ignored her i've just kind of 
Yeah babe sure and but when she's not in the bath  
bathroom I'm not using her tongue scraper because 
it just looks strange i for me based on what I  
knew about the oral microbiome and the microbiome 
generally I'm like should I be scraping off all my  
bacteria well if you're going to plant a garden 
do you plant a garden on untilled soil listen  
I know nothing about gardening you're asking the 
wrong guy so maybe yes I grow my own food okay so  
you have to till the soil right you got to break 
up the soil so the seeds actually can be irrated  
and you just break up that um that bofilm yeah you 
take the back of the dorsal tongue i mean almost  
to the point of the gag reflex and you just pull 
that ideally copper tongue scraper forward and  
you're going to see this goop coming in there but 
it's it's like kind of like tilling the soil and  
it's it's increasing the diversity of the the 
dorsal part of the tongue the microbiome so my  
girlfriend was right in that regard yes but what 
we found was in that one kid we saw the greatest  
increase in blood pressure if you tongue scrape 
and use antiseptic mouthwash that's the absolute  
worst scenario interesting so if you just think 
about this you're tongue scraping you're opening  
up the pores and now you're using mouthwash 
it's better to can easily penetrate deep in  
the crypts of the tongue and more effectively kill 
the bacteria so you want to tongue scrape and then  
use a toothbrush without fluoride toothpaste 
absolutely and no mouth no no antiseptic mouth  
rinse okay and what about going to dental 
hygienists and things like that do you think  
that's a advisable idea because once every quarter 
or so um I'll go and see a dental hygienist just  
to get everything sort of cleaned out no I think 
that's a good proactive uh practice but you know  
because you need to look at the um the health of 
the gum tissue and the the gingal tissue and a  
routine clean and scraping the the plaque off 
the teeth and allow making sure you have good  
mineralization of the enamel of the tooth is 
good but never let them do a fluoride rinse on  
you okay is there anything else on this subject 
of your microbiome and its relationship with  
nitric oxide that I need to be aware of before we 
move on yeah we there's also data showing that if  
you use mouthwash you lose the cardioprotective 
benefits of exercise so think about this we know  
that diet and exercise is the best medicine 
and many people aspire to do that they they  
go and they they try to eat good they avoid the 
temptations of sugars and sweets they exercise  
every day to try to increase their longevity and 
cardiovascular health if you do that and you're  
using mouthwash you no longer get the benefits 
from exercise and we've already established you  
don't get the nitric oxide benefits from diet so 
two out of three Americans wake up every morning  
and use mouthwash and two out of three Americans 
have an unsafe elevation in blood pressure what's  
the mechanism there well because you're you're 
killing the the the oral microbiome that's partly  
responsible for production of nitric oxide without 
nitric oxide you get constriction of blood vessels  
and it leads to high blood pressure that's crazy 
and is there a link between our hormone levels  
things like my testosterone levels and the nitric 
oxide yes so this is a two-way street so nitro So  
in men testosterone activates nitric oxide 
production okay in women estrogen activates  
and stimulates nitric oxide production okay so 
as long as we have optimal sex hormones and as  
long as the enzyme in the lining of the blood 
vessel can functionally produce nitric oxide  
that explains the cardio protective benefits of 
hormone replacement therapy got you so taking  
testosterone or um estrogen therapies helps to 
increase my nitro oxide levels as long as the  
enzyme is functional and coupled which means that 
we have to we have to understand the enzyology  
and the biochemistry of that reaction to where 
when it's exposed to testosterone it the cell  
can actually make nitric oxide in response 
and there's a two-way relationship as well  
with exercise then because I've read in your book 
that um exercise activates and stimulates nitric  
oxide production but you also just told me that 
if you want to get the great benefits of exercise  
you need nitric oxide in the first place because 
else your blood cells are going to be very narrow  
less oxygen traveling through you're going to do a 
worse workout as well presumably well think about  
I mean there's other agonist too like vitamin D 
i mean most Americans are deficient in vitamin D  
uh people with low testosterone have erectile 
dysfunction and why is that because they're not  
stimulating nitric oxide production and they're 
not dilating the blood vessels so they develop  
ED so all of this no matter what it is whether 
it's related to vitamin D deficiency which is  
activating and stimulating of nitric oxide if it's 
low hormones if it's poor diet sedentary lifestyle  
all of that can be explained by insufficient 
nitric oxide production when I think about the  
role that food plays in my nitric oxide production 
what should I be eating to increase um my nitric  
oxide levels or to keep them at a healthy level i 
think it the same answer is for that too it's it's  
not so much what we should be eating it's what 
we should not be eating okay so we we'll we'll  
cover those step by step number one you have 
to avoid sugar and high glycemic index foods  
because sugar is a toxin it's a poison and let's 
think about what sugar is so when we eat sugar or  
drink sugar beverages right whether it's sucrose 
whether it's fructose whether it's high fructose  
corn syrup the end result inside the human is we 
see an increase in glucose so elevation in blood  
sugar or blood glucose is diabetes right and now 
there's continuous glucose monitors that you can  
get anywhere and everybody does this so if you eat 
something and it causes an increase in your blood  
sugar blood glucose then you should avoid that 
because glucose as the name implies is glue right  
it's sticky and if we if you have a soda and you 
spill it on your countertop you come back the next  
day it's sticky right well that's what happens 
inside the body that sugar sticks to everything it  
sticks to proteins it sticks to enzymes it binds 
to hemoglobin and sugar stuck to hemoglobin is  
what we call hemoglobin A1C and what is that it's 
a it's a marker of long-term glucose control if  
you have hemoglobin A1C of greater than 5.7 you're 
diabetic so it's not just hemoglobin it sticks to  
it sticks to the enzyme that makes nitric oxide 
in in biochemistry and enzyology enzymes have to  
be able to undergo confirmational changes right 
so it transfers electrons from one donor to an  
acceptor and that's how biochemistry is is done 
but if sugar is stuck to that enzyme it locks it  
in some confirmation and it can't do its job for 
it can't make nitric oxide so sugar is an absolute  
poison and it kills many enzymes and binds to 
everything and it lowers nitric oxide production  
absolutely that's why diabetics have a 10 times 
higher incidence of heart attack stroke all cause  
mortality mortality that's why they develop neur 
neurological or peripheral neuropathy that's why  
they have non-healing wounds there's no nitric 
oxide that's why they're developing diabetic  
retinopathy macular degeneration pancreatitis 
i mean all of that can be traced back to a lack  
of nitric oxide production because the sugar 
stuck to the enzyme the sugar destroys the oral  
microbiome and completely changes the the ecology 
of the bacteria and completely shuts down nitric  
oxide production just a bit of a tangent there 
you mentioned that's why they have open wounds  
that don't Yeah diabetic ulcers okay so nitric 
oxide's playing a a role a healing role in wounds  
and scars absolutely so I've got this scar on my 
head i was playing football the other day someone  
ran into the back of my head and uh they they like 
they they passed out and um got taken away by an  
ambulance but I was just left with this big like 
scar on the back of my head which I've had like  
glue stitched so I'm wondering I'm like if I apply 
the nitric oxide serum it'll stimulate blood flow  
to that it'll improve cellular turnover and and 
heal that wound and basically remediate the scar  
and how do I do that is it Yeah so you take one 
pump from each side so one pump from this side  
and turn it around one pump from the other yeah 
and now if you apply that and mix it together as  
soon as you mix it together it starts to generate 
nitric oxide gas so then that gas will diffuse  
into that tissue it's going to increase blood 
flow and it's going to mobilize stem cells and  
it's going to improve cellular turnover and 
completely remodel that and heal that and if  
it were an infection in there it would kill the 
the the infectious bacteria okay well we shall we  
shall see if that worked so back on this point of 
food then so sugar's bad sugar's bad yeah you got  
to eliminate sugar and I think the benefits of it 
like a straight ketogenic diet or a straight you  
know vegan vegetarian diet is just the elimination 
of sugar and carbs right but I think to answer  
your question what should we be eating i think 
you've got to eat a balanced diet in moderation  
you know Americans are overfed all you got to do 
is walk around and see the the epidemic of obesity  
good high quality protein good quality fats and 
little or no carbs and it's really that simple and  
why did you write a book about beetroots beets 
yeah the beets hit the uh really the airwaves  
back in 2012 in the London Olympic Games mhm uh 
there was a lot of data coming out at the time  
of the benefits of beetroot juice on enhancing 
athletic performance and there was a a benefit  
of the nitric oxide being produced that could 
explain the improvement in athletic performance  
the problem is these athletes were drinking liters 
and liters of beetroot juice and causing a lot of  
gastric discomfort causing diarrhea their urine 
and their feces would turn red and a lot of people  
interpreted misinterpreted that as gastric bleeds 
or urinary bleeds and then when I started looking  
at the products on the market most of the bead 
products the desiccated bead powders provided  
zero nitric oxide benefit they didn't contain any 
nitrate no nitrite they were just we called them  
dead beats they're they're a dead beat product 
and so I thought if people if consumers are out  
there looking for beets because they've been 
shown to enhance their performance but that  
enhancement in performance was dependent upon the 
beets ability to improve nitric oxide production  
in the body then the non-scientist out there 
wouldn't know what to look for right they're  
buying products that aren't providing any benefit 
to them and so years ago we would do randomized  
placeboc controlled clinical trials and we would 
take some of these commercial bead products that  
you can go to your local nutrition store or 
pharmacy buy off the shelf and we would use  
those as placeos in our clinical trials because 
it's the perfect placebo so what I tried to do in  
that book is educate okay what is it about beets 
that are so important what's the mechanism and  
what is necessary in those beets that can improve 
nitric oxide production so again everything I do  
is intended to educate and inform the consumer 
so that they know how to make informed educated  
choices on the products they're taking or the 
foods they're eating or their oral hygienic
practices trying to find the page in your book 
but there was a page in your book where you  
describe beetroot as the most un as the most 
underappreciated food in the history of eating  
yeah that may be in the beat the odds um I 
thought it was in this book but if you if you  
go back to historical times and you look at the 
the hieroglyphics on caves of the ancient cavemen  
you know people thought they were drinking wine 
because they would have these red stuff in this  
before battle but what these ancient Egyptians 
were doing was they were drinking beet juice  
to improve their performance before they went 
into battle so that they were ready they were  
energized they improved their circulation 
so that's the historical study on beets and  
obviously these were beets grown at a time when 
there were no herbicides pesticides and the soil  
was probably fertile so these beets were full of 
nutrients probably full of nitrate that provided  
the the benefits of that but unfortunately today 
the beets that are grown at least in America um  
really are nutrient depleted just like most of the 
food so would you recommend people eat beetroots  
no because as would again through our survey 
that we published in 2015 we realized that  
you really can't eat enough beets to get enough 
nitrate to improve your performance and the other  
caveat is that if you're using mouthwash you've 
got fluoride in your toothpaste or fluoride in  
your drinking water that you're mixing the beet 
powder in you're not going to get a nitric oxide  
benefit from it there's a graph in front of me 
here which I printed off which shows the rise  
in antacid medications oh yeah from 2004 to so a 
20-year period we're seeing um what is that almost  
a quadrupling of the use of ant acids and this is 
globally or is this in the US that's worldwide I  
believe yeah worldwide now this is the problem I 
mean these these ant acids what is an antacid so  
it's a medication that's given orally to suppress 
stomach acid production and as a biochemist  
and physiologist I can't think of nothing more 
damaging than to inhibit stomach acid production  
because stomach acid is required to break down 
proteins into amino acids whether it's you're  
eating animal protein or or plant-based protein 
it's required for nutrient absorption you need  
stomach acid to absorb B vitamins you need stomach 
acid to absorb selenium chromium iodine magnesium  
iron i mean most nutrients micronutrients 
are absorbed in the lumen of the stomach  
and if the stomach cannot is not making stomach 
acid then these nutrients are not absorbed and  
most Americans 75% of Americans are deficient in 
magnesium 95% of Americans are deficient in iodine  
i mean it's a huge problem these are the brands 
like Gavascon no these are like the the prylok the  
previsids the nexium the prescription medications 
are omerazol pentopresol these you today in in the  
US I think it's probably worldwide you don't even 
need a prescription for these from your physician  
you can go to your local drugstore and you can buy 
these what we call proton pump inhibitors or PPIs  
what about Tums over the killer Tums so there's 
a difference in so Tums and things like baking  
soda are a buffer right sodium bicarb or calcium 
carbonate and it's a buffer right so if you if you  
have an acute bout of hyper secretion of acid you 
can take a Tums or some buffer some base alkaline  
substance to neutralize the acid neutralizing 
acid is completely different than inhibiting its  
natural production in the polyoric cells of the 
stomach so what is the difference between some  
have you heard of gavascon before yes yeah what's 
the difference between like a gavon well there's  
there's certain classes of ant acids there's what 
we call H2 blockers there's proton pump inhibitors  
and then there's the natural buffers that are 
just kind of neutralizing the acid environment in  
the stomach gavascon I'm trying to think um what 
class that falls under i don't think it's widely  
used here in the US i mean the main drugs used 
here are Prolysk Nexium Previsid those are the  
overthec counter and then the main prescription 
medications are the omeraol and the pentoresol  
gabaskcon is a commonly used antacid brand and 
the active ingredients are aluminium hydroxide and  
magnesium carbonate oh so Gavascon so number one 
it's got aluminum in it which you should should  
absolutely be avoided uh but yeah that just 
it looks like a buffer it's got an hydroxide  
aluminum hydroxide which is a strong base so it's 
neutralizing the stomach acid production but it's  
it's a neutralizing agent but anything that 
contains aluminum you should absolutely avoid  
um my as I mentioned her a few times today but 
my girlfriend's a breath practitioner she runs  
a business called barley breathwork.com hashtag 
ad um and one of the things she's talked to me a  
lot about is mouth breathing and I know there's 
a a relationship between nitric oxide and how we  
choose to breathe whether it's through our nose 
or through our mouths can you explain to me that  
that link you know when we talk about the enzyme 
that's found in the lining of the blood vessels  
we started this segment that same enzyme is 
found in our epithelial cells in our upper  
airways in our sinuses so just like exercise can 
activate nitric oxide production in the lining of  
the blood vessels deep breathing nasal breathing 
activates that enzyme in the epithelial cells of  
our sinuses and so when we do nasal breathing it's 
activating the enzyme to make nitric oxide and now  
we're delivering that nitric oxide gas into the 
the bronchules the lower airway it's dilating  
those bronchioles moreover it's dilating the 
pulmonary arteries so now we're improving oxygen  
uptake oxygen delivery and that's why nasal 
breathing and deep breathing has been shown  
to lower blood pressure this is a pretty crazy 
graph I took from Google as well which shows  
just how interested people are now getting in the 
subject of mouth breathing oh yeah again going  
over the past uh 20 years yeah i know I think 
there's a lot of people I mean obviously your  
girlfriend there's a Patrick Mchuan Mchuan in um 
Oh yeah the UK came into Dragon's Den I and I uh  
did a made a minoffer in Dragon's Den no I think 
that the the the benefits of that are pretty well  
and mechanistically we understand the benefits 
of it so the the mouth breathers are not only  
bypassing this natural nitric oxide production 
pathway but when you mouth breathe it completely  
changes the microbiome and you so you're not 
only bypassing the nitric oxide producing in  
the upper airway but you're inhibiting nitric 
oxide production in the mouth from the microbiome  
because you're fully oxygenating the mouth it's 
changing the pH of the saliva and completely  
changes the microbiome and completely shuts down 
nitric oxide production interesting interesting  
so so you have to I mean I'm a big fan of of 
mouth taping but for me I know and I watch my  
kids but sometimes there's anatomical issues where 
there's obstructive airways and airway obstruction  
that has to be corrected by dental appliances 
or some sometimes surgery but the worst thing  
you can do is tape your mouth and your airway be 
constricted and you know suffocate so before you  
do mouth taping you need to get um you know some 
some imaging done from your dentist to make sure  
that your airway is is open to where if you forced 
to breathe through your nose you can actually have  
oxygen exchange and is there anything else that I 
could and should be doing to increase and improve  
my nitric oxide levels that we haven't talked 
about yet humming you know there are certain  
frequencies um we've done this and looking at 
nitric oxide coming out of the exhaled breath  
when you're humming so certain frequencies can 
activate this enzyme and it's dependent upon the  
volume of the nasal sinuses so there's not one 
frequency that would work in every single person  
because the volume of your airways and and oral 
cavity and sinuses was probably much different  
than mine give me an example show me well if you 
just you know like ohms like you do in meditation  
or just simple humming you could actually so if 
I had my ozone or gasphase analyzer here I could  
hum and I could detect nitric oxide coming out 
of my exhaled breath because of the frequency  
of the because of the frequency and activating 
the the nitric oxide synthes enzyme but if you  
take older patients and we've demonstrated this 
it's published years ago and other other groups  
have demonstrated this older patients that their 
enzyme isn't making nitric oxide whether they do  
nasal breathing or whether they do humming there's 
no nitric oxide coming out so again this is an  
activator and a stimulator but it's dependent upon 
the function of the enzyme that makes nitric oxide  
if your enzyme is broken humming nasal breathing 
exercise isn't going to produce any nitric oxide  
is there anything else that I should be aware of 
if I'm trying to improve my nitric oxide levels i  
think it's it's it's doing the things that disrupt 
it get rid of fluoride get rid of mouthwash stop  
using ant acids stop eating sugar anything that 
leads to an elevation in blood sugar a balanced  
diet in moderation moderate physical exercise 20 
to 30 minutes of sunlight a day sunlight sunlight  
there are certain at both both ends of the 
visible spectrum both or the UV spectrum and the  
um full spectrum infrared so those frequencies and 
vibrations again stimulate nitric oxide release  
so the UV has enough energy to where it'll it'll 
knock nitric oxide bound to a cysteine and protein  
and then the UV spectrum will release nitric oxide 
bound to metals so you mean go out in the sunshine  
but also those red light beds and stuff yeah the 
red light I have an inf I have a red light bed i  
have an infrared sauna that uses red lights in 
it and it's I use it every day for nitric oxide  
production yeah and there's there's other benefits 
of light you know it can stimulate mitochondrial  
biogenesis it improves energy production it can 
lower blood pressure but yeah lots of benefits  
of light therapy and yet we're programmed to 
not go outside if we go outside put on SPF 60  
and intoxicate oursel with these cancer-causing 
chemicals and sunscreen I mean makes no sense what  
is the most important thing we haven't talked 
about that we should have talked about today  
Dr nathan you know I think the future of Well I I 
don't think I'm I'm I know you know there's three  
levels of conviction you think you believe and 
you know i'm at the point of knowing now that  
the future of medicine and health care around the 
globe is going to be dependent upon nitric oxide  
product technology because I think we can inform 
and instruct people to stop doing things or start  
doing things but the most difficult thing to do 
is to change people's habits and to get people  
out of their comfort zone and stop drinking 
sugar soda waters eliminate sugar to the best  
extent possible get 20 30 minutes of exercise a 
day and completely change your diet compliance is  
an issue people don't do that they we're we're 
programmed to want to take a pill to overcome  
everything and there's that pill nitric oxide is 
very important but it's not a silver bullet it's  
not going to overcome all your bad habits but what 
it is going to do it's going to correct a lot of  
the things that your bad habits are leading to a 
deficiency of well it's a good thing we have um  
a lot of people that are devoted to finding new 
solutions to old problems and you're certainly  
one of those people and it's super fascinating 
because as you say as I said at the start of  
this conversation I had no idea about any of this 
stuff beforehand i had no idea I'd not really even  
heard that the word nitric oxide and maybe I'd 
heard it in passing but um maybe I was confusing  
it with that NOS gas that people talk about and 
that some people inhale and maybe because I hadn't  
added context and story and understanding to it 
maybe I'd heard it in passing but didn't know  
what it was or meant so it's really wonderful that 
you're leading the charge in educating the world  
on nitric oxide because it's clearly a a really 
really important molecule in the the broader  
picture of our health and the more we understand 
it the more we ask questions about it and have  
curiosity about it the higher the probability 
that we're going to be able to build some of  
these therapies that prevent us from ending up 
in a state as we've seen in some of these graphs  
where we're deficient in nitric oxide and then 
have to deal with the downstream consequences  
of that so thank you for all the work that you're 
doing it's really really important i'm going to  
ask you one final question which is the question 
left by our previous guest Kim they don't know who  
they're leaving it for and they write it into this 
diary so the question that's been left for you
is are you happily or unhappily mated and why 
happily or unhappily mated you know one of my  
biggest challenges in life is maintaining 
balance right because I've been so focused  
on you know discovery and research and leaving a 
lasting legacy and and making innovations and and  
doing doing things in the scientific and medical 
community that many people said couldn't be done  
and so my the problem is is there's always 
a deficiency you know I've got young kids i  
spend a lot of a lot of time away and you know 
that's you know I'm happily mated but there's  
deficiencies right because again my challenge is 
always maintaining balance work home life kind  
of maintaining you know my spiritual my you 
know it's it's it's it's mental it's physical  
and it's spiritual health I'm trying to do better 
at that now but you know you can't there's always  
sacrifice right and we just have to pick pick 
our sacrifices and you know so I've got to I've  
got to choose to do better yeah everything has 
a trade-off as many of my guests have told me  
thank you so much for the work that you do 
where do people if people want to find out  
more about you if they want to read more they 
should certainly get this book which you've  
just released called The Secret of Nitric Oxide 
um I'll link it below for anyone that wants to  
have a read of this book i highly recommend you 
do because it gives an even more comprehensive  
understanding of everything we've talked about 
today and it's incredibly accessible which is  
always critically important to me um but if they 
want to find out more if they want to understand  
the products that you you sell and anything else 
where do they go well I I mean obviously I'm I'm  
here to educate and informal nitric oxide you 
know this latest book The Secret of Nitric  
oxide bringing the science to life really 
chronicles both my kind of journey through  
science and medicine as you revealed kind of my 
early years and kind of what motivated me to go  
into space but I think more importantly it tells 
the story of nitric oxide what it is what led to  
a Nobel Prize for its discovery what you can do 
to prevent the loss of this molecule so you can  
go to nathan'sbook.com or you can get it anywhere 
books are sold Amazon Barnes & Noble i've got a  
YouTube channel Dr nathan S brian nitric oxide 
where we provide education information latest  
scientific information on nitric oxide you can 
find me on social media Instagram Dr nathan S  
brian and then for those who want to follow our 
product journey and you know bringing forth safe  
and effective product technology that's none.com 
so it's the letter N the number one letter number  
one.com but you know we make products that release 
nitric oxide dr nathan Brian thank you so much for  
your time today being so incredibly generous 
but thank you so much for educating the world  
in such an articulate and accessible way on a 
subject that few of us knew very little about  
it's incredibly important work and it's gonna 
it's inspired me to think again about my diet  
and about the decisions I make the habits I have 
about exercise about sunlight exposure about my  
oral microbiome all of these things so thank you 
so much for that it's a real gift and I appreciate  
you taking the time today well thank you so much
